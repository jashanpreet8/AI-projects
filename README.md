# AI Projects Repository

Welcome to the AI Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of AI-based projects that demonstrate various concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence. These projects were developed as part of the CS50 AI course from Harvard. Each project is self-contained and includes all necessary files and instructions to understand and run the code.

## Projects

### Tic-Tac-Toe
An AI implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the minimax algorithm to ensure optimal play.

### Crossword Solver
A program that solves crossword puzzles by filling in the grid based on given clues and a word list.

### Degrees of Separation
A project that finds the shortest path between two actors in the IMDB dataset using the concept of degrees of separation.

### Heredity
An AI program that determines the probability of each family member having a particular genetic trait.

### Knights Tour
An implementation of the Knights Tour problem, where the objective is to move a knight on a chessboard such that it visits every square exactly once.

### Minesweeper
An AI agent that plays the Minesweeper game, using probabilistic reasoning to avoid mines and clear the board.

### PageRank
An implementation of the PageRank algorithm, which is used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results.
